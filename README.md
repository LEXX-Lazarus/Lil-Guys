# Lil Guys Pet Care Web App

This is a simple, real-time web application designed for you and your partner (or a small group!) to collectively care for a shared collection of virtual "Lil Guys" pets.

## Features:

* **Shared Pet List:** All users see and interact with the same adorable pets in real-time.

* **Adopt New Pets:** Easily add new "Lil Guys" to your shared collection, choosing their type and giving them a name.

* **Feed Your Pets:** Keep your "Lil Guys" happy by feeding them various treats, which increases their happiness level.

* **Food Preferences:** Each pet type has unique food preferences, meaning some foods will make them happier, while others might decrease their happiness!

* **Chewing Meter:** A visual chewing bar appears after feeding, showing the cooldown period before your pet can be fed again.

* **Happiness Decay:** Pets' happiness levels will gradually decrease over time (every 12 hours), adding a realistic care element and encouraging regular interaction.

* **Speech Bubbles:** Your "Lil Guys" can now express themselves! Speech bubbles will periodically appear above your selected pet, showing various messages based on their mood and type.

* **Real-time Updates:** Changes made by one user (feeding a pet, adding a new one, or happiness decay) are instantly reflected for everyone.

* **Happiness Tracking:** Monitor each pet's happiness level with a visual bar and mood emoji.

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience on any screen size.

## Technology Stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript

* **Backend/Database:** Google Firebase (Authentication for anonymous sign-in, Firestore for real-time data storage)
